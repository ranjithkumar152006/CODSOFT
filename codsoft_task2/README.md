# Tic-Tac-Toe AI using Minimax Algorithm

## Project Overview

This project implements an **unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI** using the **Minimax algorithm**.  
The AI plays optimally against a human player by evaluating all possible game states and choosing the best move.

This project helps in understanding:

- Game Theory
- Search Algorithms
- Decision Making in AI

## Algorithm Used

### Minimax Algorithm

- The AI tries to **maximize** its score.
- The human player tries to **minimize** the AI’s score.
- The algorithm explores all possible future game states.
- Guarantees **win or draw** for the AI.

## Game Rules

- Board size: **3 × 3**
- Human Player: **X**
- AI Player: **O**
- Players take turns placing their symbol.
- First player to align 3 symbols wins.

## Features

- Human vs AI gameplay
- Unbeatable AI logic
- Clean and simple Python code
- Console-based interaction
- No external libraries required

## Game Rules

- The board has 9 positions (0–8)
- Players take turns placing their symbol
- A player wins if they align 3 symbols:
  - Horizontally
  - Vertically
  - Diagonally
- If all cells are filled and no one wins, the game is a draw

## Board Position Reference

0 | 1 | 2
--+---+--
3 | 4 | 5
--+---+--
6 | 7 | 8

## How to Run the Program

1.  Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2.  Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or any IDE.
3.  Open the terminal or command prompt.
4.  Run the program using:
    python tic_tac_toe.py
5.  Follow on-screen prompts to choose your symbol and make moves.
6.  The game will display the board after every move and announce the result.

## Sample Output

Choose your symbol (X/O): X

X | O | X
---+---+---
O | X | O
---+---+---
X | o | O

🎉 Congratulations! You win!
